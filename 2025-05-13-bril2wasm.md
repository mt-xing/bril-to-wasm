# Project Goal
Our goal was to take on the Bril2wasm project as proposed on the github final project ideas discussion board. To do this, we collaborated with the group consisting of Gerardo Teruel and Dev Patel, as they were planning to do the Bril relooper project. Our tool takes in a Briloop program, in its JSON format, then converts this AST into an equivalent and runnable web assembly program.

# Implementation
We built a tool to compile Bril programs into WebAssembly, and then executed the resulting program using wasmtime. This allowed us to test our output WebAssembly programs for correctness and performance against the original equivalent Bril programs.

To begin, we used Gemini to generate a runtime library, which provides functions to print base values– ints and bools– to the terminal. We could then statically linked this into our output WebAssembly program that we generated. We made this choice because this process of printing WebAssembly values was highly nontrivial but also extremely non-interesting to the aims of the project, namely the translation between Bril (in Brilooped form) and WebAssembly. However, we found that using Gemini was nearly as much of a struggle as writing the code ourselves; it took nearly 10 back and forth interactions to get something that was even compiled.

Next, we built a type system in typescript to encode these Brilooped programs and their instructions, and then the bulk of the project was matching across the input json Brilooped instruction types, and converting them linearly into WebAssembly instructions. For the most part, we used a simple system of storing all variables in WebAssembly locals and shuttling them onto and off the stack only when needed for each instruction. This may not be as efficient as a more sophisticated register allocation algorithm, but it allowed us to guarantee correctness with high confidence.

The most difficult instructions to translate were those involving control flow– namely, if, while, break, and continue. Luckily, we were able to convert Bril if into the WebAssembly if instruction directly, simply changing the syntax as otherwise the instructions act statically the same. For while commands, we wrapped an outer block with an inner loop, where any continue statement simply jumped to the next iteration of the loop, while break jumped out of the block. In order to do this, we maintained a stack of label names, one label for each iteration of the loop, so when we need to break multiple layers back, we could refer back to previous iterations of the loop by jumping to the label corresponding to the current index of the stack.

# Challenges
In general, we found that the earliest parts of the project were the most difficult. At first, we had to decide what language to work in, as the three of us had been using different languages for our 6120 homework assignments all semester long; Serena using Rust, Annabel using Python, and Michael using Typescript. Eventually, we decided Typescript would be the most natural choice for this project due to its robust type system and ease of learning. However, it was still difficult as Serena and Annabel had limited experience using this language.

Crucially, no one on our team had substantial prior experience with WebAssembly itself. This made it difficult at the very start of the project to know how to even begin– we went crawling through the WebAssembly documentation, but unfortunately most of the examples and documentation we found online did not match the kind of thing we needed from the documentation; the general use case for WebAssembly is compiling into it using someone else’s compiler program, so much of the documentation is geared toward this use-case rather than encoding in WebAssembly itself. Much of the first half of the time we spent working on the project was simply sitting with the WebAssembly documentation, trying to understand the way the system worked (we spent, for example, a good amount of time pursuing implementing the bytecodes for every WebAssembly function, before deciding not to continue with this direction, nullifying a good deal of work).

Another challenge was working with code created by another group in the class, who were working toward the same deadline we were. Throughout the course of their Brilooped project, they naturally ran into adjustments to the Brilooped format, which then cascaded into affecting our project as well; as the two were developing concurrently, we did not have a well of extensive Briloop documentation to refer back to when developing our programs. However, we did have the advantage of being able to talk to Dev and Gerardo in real time. We could, and did, ask for help directly whenever we ran into trouble, and they were really really helpful in helping us get our input from Briloop working. We’re incredibly grateful for their help throughout this process.

One more challenging aspect of the project was, for the limited capacity in which we used Gemini, wrangling the LLM to produce actually correct (or even executable) code; though it still probably saved us the time it would take to do the uninteresting bit ourselves, it was certainly not an effortless “get out of jail free” card.

# Analysis

## Testing Methodology
We tested our code thoroughly on small examples as we implemented core functionality. This allowed us to catch errors before our code became too complex to fix. After completing our implementation, we tested on the Bril benchmarks core test suite. To do this, we first took Briloop core benchmark translations, provided by the Briloop group, and translated them into json files using their Briloop2json command. After, we ran the files through our code to output the WebAssembly translation, then ran this translation using Wasmtime. We compared the output of our WebAssembly files to the output from the original Bril files. With this method, we were able to confirm correctness, in the sense that the WebAssembly output program behaved identically on our test cases to the original Bril programs (1 test per benchmark).

Note that our WebAssembly runtime prints all arguments one per line, instead of multiple arguments on the same line. Thus, our test cases ignored whitespace differences.

## Performance
Fortunately (and perhaps unsurprisingly), the WebAssembly executed significantly faster in wasmtime than the original Bril interpreter could run Bril files. Using a script that runs all of the core benchmarks in sequence using the provided arguments, we benchmarked performance using hyperfine. The original Bril interpreter took a mean of 3.883 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.106 seconds to run through the entire folder. The WebAssembly versions took only 1.043 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.044 seconds. This is an observed speed increase of over 73.1%.

# Notes and future work:
WebAssembly has some restrictions that Bril does not. For example, WebAssembly does not allow you to change the type of a variable after it is declared, while Bril has no such conditions. We currently do not support Bril programs that have variables change types during execution.

We currently only support core Bril instructions. Implementing floats proved to be rather tricky as we would have needed to write our own float printing function in WebAssembly. Since the WebAssembly documentation is rather sparse for how to actually code in the language, we decided to leave this as work for the future. For memory, the way WebAssembly handles memory is very different from how Bril handles it. Support for memory would require digging much further into the WebAssembly (and Bril) internals than we had time for, so this was also left for the future.
